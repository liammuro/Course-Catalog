## Swarthmore College

### Fall 2024

#### [ARTH 001M. First-Year Seminar: Leonardo: Artist, Engineer, Architect, and Anatomist](https://catalog.swarthmore.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=30&coid=97315)

> Leonardo da Vinci was a great anatomist, engineer, architect and inventor whose drawings circulated around the courts of Europe. In this discussion-based course we will study the inventions, writings, paintings, drawings and biographies of this important Renaissance artist. We will consider the ways in which the works, biographies, and myths of Leonardo have been analyzed (and created) over the centuries. In doing so, we will develop a critical understanding of the methods and terminology of the discipline of art history itself.

> The analysis of electrical circuits is introduced, including resistors, capacitors, inductors, op-amps, and diodes. The student will learn to develop linear differential equations to model electrical circuits, and to solve them for voltages and currents. Solutions will be formulated both in the time domain and in the frequency domain.

#### [ENGR 017. Introduction to Engineering Design](https://catalog.swarthmore.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=30&coid=100068)

> This project-based course will orient students to the field of Engineering as a human-centered discipline and provide formal study of the Engineering design process. Students will work in teams to complete two major design projects, gaining experience with prototyping and iteration, basic CAD and digital fabrication, and combining microcontrollers with simple circuits. Engineering ethics and social impacts of technology will be integrated throughout the course.
>
> All students considering the Engineering major are expected to take this course in their first semester. No prior engineering experience is required or expected. This course is available only to first-year students.

#### [PHIL 012A. Logic](https://catalog.swarthmore.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=30&coid=98182)

> An introduction to the principles of deductive logic with equal emphasis on the syntactic and semantic aspects of logical systems. The place of logic in different areas of philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics, will also be examined.
>
> Recommended for students with a strong mathematics or computer science background, and for non-freshmen who have taken no prior philosophy courses.  Required of all philosophy majors, unless they have taken PHIL 012B previously.
>

## Harvard Division of Continuing Education

### Summer 2022 - Harvard Summer School

#### [Computer Science S-111: Intensive Introduction to Computer Science Using Java](https://web.archive.org/web/20220623043812/https://cscis111.sites.fas.harvard.edu/files/syllabus.pdf)

> **Overview**  
> This course is a fast-paced and rigorous introduction to computer science. The first half of the course covers foundational programming concepts such as data types, conditional execution, iteration, and recursion. It also explores the key features of object-oriented programming, as well as the manipulation of data stored in files and arrays. The second half of the course provides a survey of fundamental data structures including lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. It explores the implementation of these data structures using both array-based and linked representations, and it examines classic algorithms that use these structures for tasks such as sorting, searching, and text compression. Techniques for analyzing the efficiency of algorithms are also covered.
>
> Problem sets require a minimum of twenty hours of work each week, including both written problems and programming exercises using the Java programming language. Graduate-credit students are expected to complete additional work. The course includes coverage of the key topics needed for the AP Computer Science A examination. For Harvard College students, the course counts as 8 degree credits but only 4 concentration credits (equivalent to Computer Science 50).
>
> **Prerequisites**  
> Familiarity with precalculus. No prior programming experience is required. Students who have completed the Harvard Extension School courses CSCI E-10a, CSCI E-10b, CSCI E-22, or CSCI E-50 cannot earn degree credit for CSCI S-111.

### Spring 2023 - Harvard Extension School

#### [Computer Science E-66: Database Systems](https://web.archive.org/web/20221107072753/https://cscie66.sites.fas.harvard.edu/)

> **Course description**  
> This course covers the fundamental concepts of database systems. Topics include data models (ER, relational, and others); query languages (relational algebra, SQL, and others); implementation techniques of database management systems (indexing structures, concurrency control, recovery, and query processing); management of semistructured and complex data; distributed and noSQL databases.

> Computer Science E-22 or the equivalent, and strong programming skills in Java.

## Brown University

### Summer 2023 - Summer@Brown

#### [Antibiotic Drug Discovery: Identifying Novel Soil Microbes to Combat Resistance](https://catalog.precollege.brown.edu/detail/CEBI0956)

> **Course Description**
>
> The main focus of the course will be for you to attempt to discover new antibiotics in soil bacteria that can ultimately be used to treat infectious diseases. Most antibiotics used today are molecules produced by soil bacteria and fungi, used as a defense mechanism to promote their own survival. It is estimated that over 10 billion bacterial cells can inhabit a single gram of soil, and the majority of them are not characterized. This course offers the opportunity to propose a hypothesis, and search and characterize novel bacteria, and determine if these newly discovered bacteria produce antibiotics.
>
> Once on campus, you will work individually and collaboratively in small groups to develop the critical thinking skills critical to being a successful scientist. You will do this in the context of antibiotic discovery and will analyze novel bacteria within soil samples. You will be introduced to PCR, Gel Electrophoresis, DNA-sequencing, bioinformatics, and laboratory tests to characterize your unique isolates.
>
> Next, you will design experiments to see if the bacterial isolates have antibiotic activity against "safe-relatives" of pathogens that are resistant to common antibiotics, and that are prevalent in hospital settings causing many infections each year. You will do bioinformatic analysis on data collected and maintained by the Tiny Earth Organization. You will present your work and learn skills related to scientific communication.
>
> By the end of this course, you will be able to:
>
> - Think like a biologist by applying the scientific method to a significant global health threat  
> - Use appropriate terms to describe antibiotic resistance and the risk that antibiotic resistance poses to global health
> - Design experiments to discover novel antibiotics
> - Analyze isolates of bacteria, characterize and identify the isolates, and determine if the isolates produce small molecules with antibiotic properties
> - Predict experimental outcomes
> - Critically analyze data and design [future] experiments
> - Communicate scientific results
>
> **Prerequisites**
>
> A.P. Biology is recommended but not required.
